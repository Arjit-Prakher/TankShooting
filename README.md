This is a project made using the graphics library (<graphics.h>) of C. The tank uses inputs from the player, to move the tank up and down, he must press ‘w’ and ‘s’ respectively. As the keys are pressed, the current coordinate of the tank increases or decreases by 5 pixels in the y-axis. The tank shoots by pressing ‘f’. This triggers a line segment to appear and move along the x-axis until it reaches the target
